             game where you'll jump higher than your opponent to claim victory!</p>

            <p>Starting the game is super easy. Just enter a number as a passcode to save your progress, give Player 1 
              and Player 2 a name, and press start. If you need to continue where you left off, just press the “load game” 
              button and enter your passcode and press start to get right back into the game.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">LEVELS</p>
          <p>With three incredible levels to explore, you'll have a blast conquering 
            each one. The first level is a peaceful meadow where you'll jump on grassy 
            platforms and use power-ups to mess with your rival. The second level is a bit 
            trickier, an ice level where you'll slide around on slippery platforms while 
            trying to jump higher than your opponent. The third and toughest level is a 
            spooky haunted castle where you'll jump on moving platforms while dodging ghosts!

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">POWER-UPS</p>
          <p>But wait, there's more! You'll come across power-ups throughout each level that 
            give you an advantage or disadvantage. Super jump will launch your character higher 
            than normal, super speed will make you run faster than ever before, and reverse
            controls will flip the direction of your opponent's controls. Watch out for the 
            ghosts in the final level, though - they'll try to spook you and freeze you for a 
            few seconds!

        <div class="textbox" style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">CONTROLS</p>
          <p>The controls are super easy to master, so you'll be jumping in no time. Player 1 
            will use the arrow keys while Player 2 will use the "wasd" keys. Use left and right 
            arrows or "a" and "d" to move left or right, and the up arrow or "w" key to jump. 
            Be careful not to fall off the platforms, or your opponent might get ahead and win 
            the game!
