## How to Play/Objective
Twoodle Jump is a modern take on the mobile game, Doodle Jump. In this game, two players compete to climb the level by jumping on platforms and collecting randomly spawning powerups. The farther you climb, the higher the camera goes. The player that falls off the screen first loses the level. Both players play until one person wins 2 games. As the game progresses, the levels become more difficult as movement becomes more prone to user error.

### Levels
#### Level 1
Get the hang of Twoodle Jump in a level void of hinderances! Level 1 is all about racing your opponent on even ground.
#### Level 2
Try not to slide off in Level 2! In the icy terrain of Snow Mountain, plan your movements carefully as any misinput could be your last!
#### Level 3
Don't be spooked! While the platforms may move by themselves, plan your jumps and look ahead to take advantage of the dynamic environment. Watch out for ghosts! If touched, your character will fall into a state of shock making them impossible to control for a few seconds!
### Tips
* Take advantage of the descend control! Less time in the air could make your climb faster.
* Slow and Steady! Any mistake could cause you to lose. Let your opponent make the mistake first!
* Can't make a jump? Jump off the left/right side of the screen to wrap around! 
## How to Create a Game
When in the Start Game screen, enter the name of player 1 and player 2. If you're a returning player, make sure to enter the same name you used before to keep track of your total wins! Afterwards, create a passcode containing of only numbers. If the passcode has already been taken, a game will not be created. If this is the case, enter a new passcode until you are able to start level 1. Make sure to remember your passcode! It is necessary to load your game.
## How to Save/Load Game
After each finished level, the game will automatically save. If you have to take a break, just close the game! Once you're ready to come back, go to the Load Game screen from the main menu and type in the passcode you used to create the game. This will take you to the current level!
